[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshvarts/AppLifecycleDemo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshvarts/AppLifecycleDemo)

*URL to Medium post covering this coming soon.*

## Implementation Detail

This project demonstrates using the new [ProcessLifecycleOwner](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/ProcessLifecycleOwner.html) (bundled with [Lifecycle Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)) to react to foreground and background events. 

This class that provides lifecycle for the whole application process.
