# App Lifecycle Demo App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshvarts/AppLifecycleDemo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshvarts/AppLifecycleDemo)

Medium post is here: http://medium.com/@jshvarts/react-to-app-foreground-and-background-events-with-processlifecycleowner-96278e5816fa

## Implementation Detail

This project demonstrates using the new [ProcessLifecycleOwner](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/ProcessLifecycleOwner.html) (bundled with [Lifecycle Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)) to react to foreground and background events. 

`ProcessLifecycleOwner` provides lifecycle for the whole application process. For more details, see my post on Medium.
